  Our project is the Camel's game which is a version of a Kittens game (https://kittensgame.com/web/#). 
  The game has multiple resource and building types. 
  Buildings produce resources which can be used to purchase other kinds of buildings.
  The game is similar to cookie clicker or other idle resource management games.
  We used curses to build a user interface in the terminal using text commands while constantly updating the screen as resources are produced
